A plugin to reform the mathNEWS article submission flow.

== Description ==

This plugin completely reforms the WordPress publishing interface. It provides:

- Specialized submission flow for contributors, including custom subtitle, author, and postscript fields
- Automated article tagging
- Streamlined approve/reject functionality for copyeditors
- Category restrictions for editors and above only
- Article locking for submitted/approved articles
- One-click image embeds for contributors
- and more!

mathNEWS currently uses this plugin, in conjunction with Classic Editor, to provide a seamless experience for writers and editors alike.
Some of the problems it has solved:

- Writers forgetting to sign off with pseudonyms
- Articles accidentally being left untagged
- Changes being made after approval, resulting in the need to review the new changes as well
- Editors accidentally publishing articles when trying to approve them
