A plugin to onboard writers to mathNEWS Core.

Requires mathNEWS Core >= 1.1.0

== Development ==

A major version update will cause the onboarding screen to be re-shown to all users.
Therefore, consider a major version update if and only if there are major breaking
changes to the workflow, such as a new field. For maintenance items like vendor
library upgrades, release a minor or patch update, even if those result in breaking
changes that would normally warrant a major update.
